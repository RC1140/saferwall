</p>

It aims for the following goals:
- Provide a collaborative platform to share samples among malware researchers.
- Acts as a system expert, to help researchers generates an automated malware analysis report.
- Hunting platform to find new malwares.
- Quality ensurance for signature before releasing.

## Features

- Static analysis:
    - Crypto hashes, packer identification

## Installation

Saferwall take advantage of [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for its high availability, scalibility and the huge ecosystem behind it. 

Everything runs inside Kubernetes. You can either deploy it in the cloud or have it self hosted.

 To make it easy to get a production grade Kubernetes cluster up and running, we use [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops). It automatically provisions a kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS, GCE, DigitalOcean or OpenStack and also on bare metal. For the time being, only AWS is officially supported.

Steps to deploy in AWS:
(This still needs to be improved)
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/saferwall/saferwall`
2. Using a debian linux, make sure `build-essential` are installed: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.
3. Rename the `example.env` to `.env` and fill the secrets according to which AVs you want to have.
4. Install it: `make saferwall`.
5. Edit the deployments/values.yaml to match your needs.
6. Logs are found elasticsearch:

Steps to deploy in on baremetal (minikube):
(This still needs to be improved)
- Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/saferwall/saferwall`
- Rename the `example.env` to `.env` and fill the secrets according to which AVs you want to have.
- Disable the couch base cluster in the helm values file
- cd deployments/saferwall && helm dependency update
- Build the different containers
  - make ui-build
    - docker build  -t saferwall/ui -f ui/Dockerfile ui/
  - make backend-build
    - docker build  -t saferwall/backend -f build/docker/Dockerfile.backend web/
  - make website-build
    - docker build  -t saferwall/website -f build/docker/Dockerfile.website website/
  - make consumer-build
    - docker build  -t saferwall/consumer -f build/docker/Dockerfile.consumer .
  - export AV_VENDOR=sophos
  - make multiav-build-av
  - make helm-init-cert-manager
  - helm install deployments/saferwall --generate-name

## Built with:

- Golang mostly.
- Backend: [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)
- Frontend: [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) + [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- Messaging: [NSQ](https://nsq.io/)
- Database: [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/)
- Logging: [FileBeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat) + [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) + [Kibanna](https://www.elastic.co/)
- Minio: [Object storage](https://min.io/)
- Deployment: [Helm](https://helm.sh/) + [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

## Current architecture / Workflow:

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/W0qXb5y.png" width="600px" height="auto"></p>

Here is a basic workflow which happens during a file scan:
- Frontend talks to the the backend via REST APIs.
- Backend uploads samples to the object storage.
- Backend pushes a message into the scanning queue.
- Consumer fetches the file and copy it into to the nfs share avoiding to pull the sample on every container.
- Consumer calls asynchronously scanning services (like AV scanners) via gRPC calls and waits for results.
